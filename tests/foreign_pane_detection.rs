//! `has_live_pane` — the predicate behind the daemon's foreign-agent warning.
//!
//! A `SessionStart` naming a pane the daemon never spawned registers a card that
//! no local pane backs: it surfaces on the dashboard and is retired again, which
//! is the "ghost agent appeared and disappeared" report. The usual cause is
//! another deck's agent posting here — most often a test child that inherited an
//! ambient `DOT_AGENT_DECK_SOCKET`. The daemon cannot refuse such events (a pane
//! may legitimately belong to a client whose agent it does not own), so it warns,
//! and this predicate is what decides.
//!
//! Fast tier: a `cat` stub, no LLM and no daemon socket.
